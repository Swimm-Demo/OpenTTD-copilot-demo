# Gameplay Overview

Gameplay in <SwmToken path="src/game/game_instance.cpp" pos="2:13:13" line-data=" * This file is part of OpenTTD.">`OpenTTD`</SwmToken> involves managing a transport company, where players build and maintain transport routes for various types of cargo and passengers. Players start by constructing basic infrastructure such as roads, railways, airports, and docks to facilitate the movement of goods and people. The game includes a variety of vehicles like trains, trucks, ships, and airplanes, each with unique characteristics and uses. Players must strategically plan routes and schedules to maximize efficiency and profitability while competing with other transport companies. The game also features economic elements, where players need to manage finances, invest in new technologies, and adapt to changing market conditions. Additionally, players can engage in various scenarios and challenges, which add depth and replayability to the game.

## Starting the Game

## <SwmToken path="src/game/game_instance.cpp" pos="34:2:4" line-data="void GameInstance::Initialize(GameInfo *info)">`GameInstance::Initialize`</SwmToken>

The <SwmToken path="src/game/game_instance.cpp" pos="34:2:4" line-data="void GameInstance::Initialize(GameInfo *info)">`GameInstance::Initialize`</SwmToken> function initializes the game instance with the provided game information. It sets the API version, registers the game controller, and initializes the main script.

```c++
void GameInstance::Initialize(GameInfo *info)
{
	this->versionAPI = info->GetAPIVersion();

	/* Register the GameController */
	SQGSController_Register(this->engine);

	ScriptInstance::Initialize(info->GetMainScript(), info->GetInstanceName(), OWNER_DEITY);
}
```

## <SwmToken path="src/game/game_instance.cpp" pos="44:2:4" line-data="void GameInstance::RegisterAPI()">`GameInstance::RegisterAPI`</SwmToken>

The <SwmToken path="src/game/game_instance.cpp" pos="44:2:4" line-data="void GameInstance::RegisterAPI()">`GameInstance::RegisterAPI`</SwmToken> function registers the API for the game instance. It registers all classes, game translations, and loads compatibility scripts.

```c++
void GameInstance::RegisterAPI()
{
	ScriptInstance::RegisterAPI();

	/* Register all classes */
	SQGS_RegisterAll(this->engine);

	RegisterGameTranslation(this->engine);

	if (!this->LoadCompatibilityScripts(this->versionAPI, GAME_DIR)) this->Died();
}
